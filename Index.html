    <h3><a href="#"> Introduction</a> </h3> 
    <p> A company, abbreviated as co., is a legal entity representing an association of people, whether natural, legal, or a mixture of both, with a specific objective. Company members share a common purpose and unite to achieve specific, declared goals. Companies take various forms, such as: voluntary associations, which may include nonprofit organizations business entities, whose aim is generating profit financial entities and banks programs or educational organizations. A company can be created as a legal person so that the company itself has limited liability as members perform or fail to discharge their duty according to the publicly declared incorporation, or published policy. When a company closes, it may need to be liquidated to avoid further legal obligations. Companies may associate and collectively register themselves as new companies; the resulting entities are often known as corporate groups. </p>

    <h3><a href="#"> Login </a></h3> In computer security, logging in (or logging on, signing in, or signing on) is the process by which an individual gains access to a computer system by identifying and authenticating themselves. The user credentials are typically some form of "username" and a matching "password",[1] and these credentials themselves are sometimes referred to as a login (or a logon or a sign-in or a sign-on).[2][1] In practice, modern secure systems often require a second factor such as email or SMS confirmation for extra security. When access is no longer needed, the user can log out (log off, sign out or sign off).
